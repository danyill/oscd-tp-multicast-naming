== What is this?

This plugin is intended to allow multicast addressing to meet Transpower requirements.

* This is a plugin for {uri-openscd-core}[open-scd-core], the core
editor engine for {uri-openscd}[OpenSCD].

* This plugin is a web component and follows the
{uri-openwc}[open-wc] recommendations.

* This plugin uses the link:LICENSE[Apache License] and is intended for you to use, study, share and improve.

{uri-openscd-core-plugin-demo}[Try it out online]!

Feel free to log issues to request fixes, improvements or new features.

== How it works

It allocates Sampled Value and GOOSE communications addressing based on the user selecting items in a table with filtering allow by message type, protectin system and primary system bus.

MAC Addresses::
* The first user-allocated octet is allocated to `00` for Prot1 and `01` for Prot2 for SMV and GSE traffic.
* MAC addresses are assigned to be unique and up to 255 are allowed.

APP IDs::
+
--
For GSE Traffic:

* Prot1 (as defined by a device whose last digit is even) trips (as defined by control block names beginning `Ctl` or `Trip`) begin at `0x8001` and go to `0x8fff`
* Prot2 (as defined by a device whose last digit is odd ) trips begin at `0x9001` and go to `0x9fff`
* Non-tripping services are allocated between `0x0001` and `0x4fff`

For SMV Traffic:

* Prot1 begins at `0x5000` and go to `0x5fff`
* Prot2 begins at `0x6000` and go to `0x6fff`
--

`appID` or `smvID`::
* For GOOSE traffic, this always the IED name a forward slash and the control block name
* For SV traffic, if the name is "TEMPLATE" it is substituted for the IED name.
* Otherwise, the `smvID` is generated with the IED name, a forward slash and the value of `smvID`.

VLAN Priority::
* All GOOSE tripping messages (as defined by control block names beginning `Ctl` or `Trip`) have Priority 6.
* All other GOOSE traffic is Priority 5
* All SMV traffic is Priority 6

GSE `MinTime` and `MaxTime`::
* All tripping messages (as defined by control block names beginning `Ctl` or `Trip`) have a `MinTime` of 4 ms and a `MaxTime` of 1000 ms.
* All other messages have a `MinTime` of 100 ms and a `MaxTime` of 1000 ms.

VLAN ID::
* VLANs are allocated on the basis of the control block name for GSE and the `smvID` for SMV (after the trailing `/`)
* They are allocated as pairs for Prot1 and Prot2 at the same time. Prot1 and Prot2 are identified by the IED name ending in an even and odd number respectively.
* A VLAN is either substation wide or on a per primary system bus basis.
* Allocation as follows

* Buses are determine by a Function named `BusPhysConnection` under a Bay in the `Substation` section with a `name` which begins `Bus` followed by an underscore and the bus name.
** The bus `name` attribute is the definition of "bus" in the above.
* Within the function, there will be a single `LPHD` for each device (although any logical node reference will do)
* This will be for Generation 1 substations (at least for this initial design).

VLANs can be viewed and exported to another file (to keep allocations consistent between protection systems if files are managed separately).
An export to csv of all (or selected) publishing information is provided.

=== Storing VLAN Information

VLAN information is stored within the `Communication` section as a `Private` element, in the following form:

[source,xml]
----
<Private type="Transpower-VLAN-Allocation" etpc:updated="2023-08-21 13:01:53 +12:00">

== Using the Plugin

Follow the steps in <<Loading the Plugin>>.
Once the plugin is loaded:

. The plugin provides a menu option. Go to the menu in the top left and click on the plugin name.

. Then click enabled and then "Close".
+
image::../../test/screenshots/baseline/configure the plugin is initially disabled-Chromium.png[]

. In either the publisher or subscriber view, click on the settings icon (a cog) and check that "Allow External Plugins" is checked.

. The plugin will automatic add or remove subscriptions as required.

== Loading the Plugin

=== Online Using the Latest open-scd-core

==== Using a URL

Open SCD core allows plugins to be loaded from a URL.

You can click on {uri-openscd-core-plugin}[this link] to trial this plugin.

In this view it is without theming and only presents this plugin along with the open and save plugins.

==== Manually

. The latest core is available at {uri-openscd-core-app}.

. Go to menu:Menu[Add plugins...]

. Select Cancel - this is an editor plugin.

. Select OK to required a loaded document.

. Choose a plugin name of '{plugin-name}'.

. Choose a plugin icon of 'link'

. Provide a plugin source URI of: {uri-ci-bundle}

. Click OK on the summary, it should indicate the parameters previously entered.

. Open a file and enjoy!

=== Locally for testing

. Clone this project:
+
[subs=+attributes]
....
$ git clone {uri-plugin}
....

. Install dependencies

  $ npm i

. Start up a demo server

  $ npm run start

. Open in your browser locally at http://localhost:8000/demo/

=== As part of the OpenSCD distribution

TIP: OpenSCD is transitioning to use of `open-scd-core`, these instructions will require updating at the end of this transition.

. Open your OpenSCD distribution or use {uri-openscd-app}.

. Create a custom extension by going to menu:menu[Extensions>Add Custom Extension].

. Enter the name '{plugin-name}', select 'Menu entry' and enter {uri-ci-bundle} as the URL.
+
This is the URL of the bundle built by CI and is always the latest pre-release version of this plugin.
+
.OpenSCD Add Custom Extension Screen
image::screenshot-add-extension.png[width=300]

. Click on menu:Add[].

. This plugin is now available in the menu entry.

=== As part of your own distribution

==== Within the current OpenSCD distribution

. Within the current OpenSCD distribution, plugins are stored in the `public/js/plugins.js` folder.
Each plugin appears in the following form:
+
[source,js,subs=+attributes]
----
{
    name: '{plugin-name}', // <.>
    src: '{uri-ci-bundle}', //  <.>
    icon: 'sim_card_download', // <.>
    default: true, // <.>
    kind: 'menu', // <.>
    requireDoc: true, // <.>
    position: 'middle' // <.>
  }
----
<.> Name of the plugin which appears in the editor menu at top of screen
<.> URL which can be a local or remote resource.
For a local resource, begins without a forward slash, e.g. `plugins/oscd-tp-multicast-naming/dist/oscd-tp-multicast-naming.js`.
In this case what is shown is loading a plugin from the build process.
<.> A material icon, see others at {uri-material-icons}[Material Symbols and Icons]
<.> Whether the plugin is enabled by default or has to be enabled in the plugins menu
<.> The type of plugin, either `menu` or `editor`. This is an `editor` plugin.
<.> Whether a document must be loaded for this plugin to be available
<.> A string, either `top`, `middle` or `bottom` to give a location in the menu.
Otherwise inferred from the order in the file relative to other plugins.

. You need to copy an entry like the above, ensure the `src` URL resolves and the plugin should be loaded when the distribution is built.

. If you are building locally you likely need to run an `npm run bundle` command in each plugin to make the `dist` folder, containing a single JavaScript file with the plugin available to OpenSCD.

==== Within an OpenSCD core distribution

Within an OpenSCD core distribution, plugins are also loaded from a json file with a slightly different schema.

. Typically the distribution will be served from a static web page and within the web page there will be a plugins property declared on an `open-scd` object, for instance:
+
[source,js,subs=+attributes]
----
include::demo/index.html[tag=plugins]
----

. This plugin is an editor plugin, editor plugins are an array of JSON of the following form:
+
[source,js,subs=+attributes]
----
{
  "name": "{plugin-name}", // <.>
  "translations": { // <.>
    "de": "Kommunikationsexport",
    "pt":"Exportação de Comunicações"
  },
  "icon": "sim_card_download", // <.>
  "active": true, // <.>
  "requireDoc": true, // <.>
  "src": "/dist/oscd-tp-multicast-naming.js" // <.>
}
----
<.> Name of the plugin which appears in the editor menu at top of screen
<.> Translations of the plugin name as required using standard locale names.
<.> A material icon, see others at {uri-material-icons}[Material Symbols and Icons]
<.> Whether the plugin is enabled by default or has to be enabled in the plugins menu
<.> Whether a document must be loaded for this plugin to be available
<.> URL which can be a local or remote resource.
For a local resource, begins with a forward slash, e.g. `plugins/oscd-tp-multicast-naming/dist/oscd-tp-multicast-naming.js`.
In this case what is shown is loading a plugin from the internet using the continuous integration build process.

. You need to copy an entry like the above, ensure the `src` URL resolves and the plugin should be loaded when the distribution is built.

. If you are building locally you likely need to run an `npm run bundle` command in each plugin to make the `dist` folder, containing a single JavaScript file with the plugin available to OpenSCD.

== Development

=== Linting and formatting

To scan the project for linting and formatting errors, run

[source,bash]
----
npm run lint
----

To automatically fix linting and formatting errors, run

[source,bash]
----
npm run format
----

=== Testing with Web Test Runner

To execute a single test run:

[source,bash]
----
npm run test
----

To run the tests in interactive watch mode run:

[source,bash]
----
npm run test:watch
----

=== Tooling configs

For most of the tools, the configuration is in the `package.json` to reduce the number of files in your project.

If you customize the configuration a lot, you can consider moving them to individual files.

=== Local Demo with `web-dev-server`

To run a local development server that serves the basic demo located in `demo/index.html`

[source,bash]
